###  PiRoutine is a morning alarm system that uses a port forwarded raspberry pi, that's wired via relay switch to a water pump, and interacted with through a deployed front end. 
 ### All of which aims to instill good habits in the user, starting by waking up on time.

###  This is done by leveraging a pavlovian fear of laying in bed too long after they've heard their external alarm go off, by soaking the user and/or their bed with water. In return, the user quickly learns to wake up alongside their external alarm, jumping out of bed, ready to start their day with a light jog!

## Phase 1 - Disarming Alarm 1
  After waking up by an external alarm, it's suggested to give yourself 5-10 minutues before PiRoutine's first alarm goes off. 
- (EX: External = 5:00AM, PiRoutine = 5:10AM)

Once awake, unlock and disarm the initial alarm, before the current time hits alarm 1. 
- Failure to do so, will result in the pump going off.

- Once unlocked, other secured functionalities include: 
  - The ability to change PiRoutine's initial alarm.
  - The ability to skip the current or upcoming day. While this will be recorded as a failure, it will not trigger the pump.

## Phase 2 - Beginning My Routine Run
  After the initial alarm is disarmed, I begin my morning run / walk. Waking up the body and getting the blood pumping.
- Note that while traveling, the client remains responsive to the users distance traveled.

## Phase 3 - Disarming Alarm 2
  After the distance is traveled (roughly 0.25mi-0.5mi), disarm the final alarm. 
- Failure to do so, will result in the pump going off.

- Note that the metadata is updated on its own upon the current time reaching the final alarm time.

## Checking My Records
  Keeping me consistant and inspired, in addition to the streak / max streak tracking I included, I can also check my previous records whenever I want.
- White data entry indicates, I successfully stuck to my routine that day.
- Red data entry indicates, I failed to stick to my routine that day.

## Raspberry Pi Installation
  The raspberry pi is connected to a water pump, stored inside the 5 gallon bucket beside the bed. The pump has tubing connecting it to a piece of conduit with holes drilled into it, attached to my headboard.

One day, I plan on making a video. Meanwhile, just ask if you'd like help setting up.
