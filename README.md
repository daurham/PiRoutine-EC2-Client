# PiRoutine ‚è∞üí¶üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
PiRoutine is a morning alarm system that uses a port forwarded raspberry pi, relay switch wired to a water pump and a deployed front end, to instill good habits in the user by waking up on time. This is done by leveraging a pavlovian fear of laying in bed after they've heard their alarm go off for too long, with getting sprayed with water. In return, the user wakes up before their alarm, and/or when they wake up by it, they jump out of bed! Ready to start their day!

## Phase 1 - Disarming Alarm 1
Unlock and disarm the initial alarm, before the current time hits alarm 1. 
- Failure to do so, will result in the pump going off.
- Once unlocked, other secured functionalities include: 
- 1. The ability to change the desired alarm time
- 2. Skip the current or upcoming day. While this results in a recorded failure, it will not trigger the pump.

## Phase 2 - Beginning My Routine Run
After the initial alarm is disarmed, I begin my morning run / walk. While traveling, notice how the client remains responsive to the users distance traveled.

## Phase 3 - Disarming Alarm 2
After the distance is traveled (roughly 0.25mi-0.5mi), disarm the final alarm. 
- Failure to do so, will result in the pump going off. 
- Note that the metadata is updated on its own upon the current time reaching the final alarm time.

## Phase # - Checking My Records
Keeping me consistant and inspired, in addition to the streak / max streak tracking I included, I can also check my previous records whenever I want.
- White data entry indicates, I successfully stuck to my routine that day.
- Red data entry indicates, I failed to stick to my routine that day.

## Raspberry Pi Installation
The raspberry pi is connected to a water pump in the 5 gallon bucket, and some tubing is feeding it to a piece of conduit with holes drilled into, attached to my headboard.

- clone on your pi and local computer.
- run: npm install
pi:
- From the dir root, run: sudo node piServer/server.js
local computer:
- termianl 1 run: npm start
- termianl 2 run: npm run server

- fill out your ideal wake up time, store in database.
- use a relay module connected to a water pump in a bucket to
